# About Me

Currently a Computer Science student trying to learn as much as I can. I am mostly interested in low-level programming, as it allows me to combine software with hardware and make projects more engaging. However, this does not stop me from working on higher-level tasks as well.

Currently learning:
- **C, C++, and STM HAL**
- **Soldering**
- **Electronics**

Current projects:
- **Mini Sumo Robot** – an autonomous robot developed in a group as a collaborative learning project
- **LED Cube Tic-Tac-Toe** – a 4×4×4 LED cube created for an embedded systems course, using an ESP32 as the microcontroller

Planned projects:
- **Hexapod 2.0** – based on STM HAL and inverse kinematics
- **Productivity Calendar** – a tool to track my productivity

Previous experience:
- **Languages:** C++, HTML/CSS, SQL, JavaScript, Python
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Visual Studio Code, MSYS2
- **Databases:** MySQL
